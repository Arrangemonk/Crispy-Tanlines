	Gameplay Overview
		The Player Views the beach from towp with the Sunbathing Girl in the center,
		The player can readjust a Sun Umbrella (grab -> place -> Adjust)
		The player can grad items/creatures from the beac, which get stored in 8 item slots on the right
		3 items from the slots can be selected to create sun lotion from
		sun lotion can be sprayed on the girl for extra protection, and depending on quality
		shields from sun or makes is worse
		a spray bottle lasts 30 seconds, and then new sunscreen has to be mixed
	Theme Interpretation(Shadows and Alchemy)
		the umbrella creates the shadow so you can control the shadow
		and the sunscreen represents the alchemy, since its mixed from random ingredients and
		a good mixture is found by trail and error
	Primary Mechanics
		Umbrella
			the umbrella provides 60% of protection, when fully shadowing the girl
			but it gets knocked around alot by wind, so it has to be readjusted, or can be lost , 
			as it can leave the playfield but the player can not
		Ingredients
			random creatures and plants commonfly found at beaches can be picked up
			for example:
			crabs, shells, sand, sea urchin, sea star, seaweed, 
		mixing
			mark 3 collected items and click on the blender in the bottom which creates a spray bottle
		spraying
			grab spraybottle and click on girl and effect is applied, the effect lasts 5 seconds
		discarding
			right click discards the spray bottle, bad sunscreen should be discarded, also the umbrella
			can not be adjusted with spray bottle in hand, so you have to get a free hand to adjusted
		health bar
			the healt bar shrinks constantly except for when perfect sun protection is applied
			the amount of shrinkage depends on the protection, so a sunburn comes after 2 minutes without protection
			and after 4 minutes with just umbrella
		Design
			Plainted Backgrounds and Hand drawn (digital painting) Anime girl and creatures, the umbrella is 3d
